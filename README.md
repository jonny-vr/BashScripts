# BashScripts
After learning about Linux in Uni, I'm starting to write my own bash scripts. ðŸ˜Š

## PDF Search Script

This script helps you find specific words in multiple PDF files at once. Using wildcards is highly recommended.

### Functionality

The script searches for words in PDF files and prints the lines containing the words, along with the respective file. It also supports options like -B and -A to display a specific number of lines before and after the word. By default, it ignores case when searching.

Feel free to use and modify this script as needed! Happy scripting! ðŸš€

## Usage

The script is called as follows:

```bash
./search -B <before_lines> -A <after_lines> "<keyword>" <file1.pdf> <file2.pdf> ...
```

## Example Usage

**Command:**

```bash
$ search "Iterative deepening" Folien/*
```

**Output:**
```bash
